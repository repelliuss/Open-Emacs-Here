# WSL-Context-Menu-Manager
Aiming to manage context menu for your Linux apps in WSL/WSL2 using Windows Terminal.

# Progress Status
At first project was only focusing on Emacs on WSL/WSL2 but now i decided to generalize the project and make something that everyone can add and delete their apps on WSL/WSL2 in a few days.
